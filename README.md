<h1 align="center"><b><strong>Horas! :smile: I'm Walker Simanjuntak </strong></b></h1>

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Information Systems at Institut Teknologi Del, Sitoluama. I believe that success can be achieved through hard work and that failure is one of the keys to a successful journey. As a motivated student, I am not afraid to fail because I believe that failure is an essential part of the path to success. I am also someone who enjoys trying new things and collaborating with others to achieve something great.
